                    <h2>The History of gaming:</h1>
                    <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify">The first recognized example of a game machine was unveiled by Dr. Edward Uhler Condon at the New York World’s Fair in 1940. The game, based on the ancient mathematical game of Nim, was played by about 50,000 people during the six months it was on display, with the computer reportedly winning more than 90 percent of the games.

                        However, the first game system designed for commercial home use did not emerge until nearly three decades later, when Ralph Baer and his team released his prototype, the “Brown Box,” in 1967.
                        
                        The “Brown Box” was a vacuum tube-circuit that could be connected to a television set and allowed two users to control cubes that chased each other on the screen. The “Brown Box” could be programmed to play a variety of games, including ping pong, checkers and four sports games. Using advanced technology for this time, added accessories included a lightgun for a target shooting game, and a special attachment used for a golf putting game.
                        
                        According to the National Museum of American History, Baer recalled, “The minute we played ping-pong, we knew we had a product. Before that we weren’t too sure.”
                        
                        Magnavox-OdysseyThe “Brown Box” was licensed to Magnavox, which released the system as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. It  preceded Atari by a few months, which is often mistakenly thought of as the first games console.
                        
                        Between August 1972 and 1975, when the Magnavox was discontinued, around 300,000 consoles were sold. Poor sales were blamed on mismanaged in-store marketing campaigns and the fact that home gaming was a relatively alien concept to the average American at this time.
                        
                        However mismanaged it might have been, this was the birth of the digital gaming we know today.

                    <h2>The Roots Of Multiplayer Gaming:</h2>
                    <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:justify;">During the late 1970s, a number of chain restaurants around the U.S. started to install video games to capitalize on the hot new craze. The nature of the games sparked competition among players, who could record their high scores with their initials and were determined to mark their space at the top of the list. At this point, multiplayer gaming was limited to players competing on the same screen.

                        The first example of players competing on separate screens came in 1973 with “Empire” — a strategic turn-based game for up to eight players — which was created for the PLATO network system. PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operation), was one of the first generalized computer-based teaching systems, originally built by the University of Illinois and later taken over by Control Data (CDC), who built the machines on which the system ran.
                        
                        According to usage logs from the PLATO system, users spent about 300,000 hours playing Empire between 1978 and 1985. In 1973, Jim Bowery released Spasim for PLATO — a 32-player space shooter — which is regarded as the first example of a 3D multiplayer game. While access to PLATO was limited to large organizations such as universities — and Atari — who could afford the computers and connections necessary to join the network, PLATO represents one of the first steps on the technological road to the Internet, and online multiplayer gaming as we know it today.
                        
                        At this point, gaming was popular with the younger generations, and was a shared activity in that people competed for high-scores in arcades. However, most people would not have considered four out of every five American households having a games system as a probable reality.

                    <h2>Cloud Gaming Service:</h2>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;">Cloud gaming, according to the many companies entering the field, is the future of gaming. Although that’s pushing it a little far — local gaming will dominant for many decades to come — cloud gaming could be a serious alternative a few years down the line. Some services, such as Shadow and PlayStation Now, showcase that. 

                        The technology that cloud gaming uses has been around for many years, so it’s not a lack of tech that has kept cloud gaming from reaching the mainstream. Infrastructure, network capacity and remote input technology play a big role in how smooth your gaming experience is, not just your internet speed. 
                        
                        In this guide, we’re going to cover how cloud-based gaming works so you can understand if it’s a suitable solution for you. Additionally, we’re going to talk about some of the issues that come along with it, as well as the limitations of the tech in its current state. Along the way, we’ll bring in some options from our best cloud gaming guide to illustrate our points.
                        
                        <br><br>Before getting into how cloud gaming works, you have to understand what it is. Although “cloud gaming” is the buzz phrase thrown around, it could also be labeled as “remote computing.” Essentially, a cloud gaming platform allows you to access a computer remotely, either offering a full desktop experience or limiting it to only a games launcher.

                        Essentially, you’re sending commands to the remote machine by, say, moving your cursor or typing your password. The remote machine receives that command and executes it like any normal computer would. What’s happening on that remote computer is then streamed to you, and, with a small amount of latency, it can feel like real-time. 
                        
                        As is the case with streaming platforms like Netflix, cloud gaming services have adopted different video encoding methods. That allows platforms like Shadow or Vortex to adapt the video stream based on your internet speed. If your connection dips, the video will show more compression artifacts. 
                        
                        In short, cloud gaming is a video stream that you can control. For some platforms, that means you can control a full desktop experience, while in others, it’s restricted to the game itself. That’s a basic overview, but it gets a little more complex than that. Let’s talk more specifically about how cloud gaming works and the limitations that come with it.</p>
